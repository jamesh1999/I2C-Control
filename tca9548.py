"""TCA9548 - device access class for the TCA9548 I2C bus multiplexer.

This class implements support for the TCA9548 I2C bus multiplexer. Designed to
be used in conjunction with the the I2CDevice and I2CContainer classes, it allows
the TCA output channel to be transpartently selected for any access to a device
attached to an instance of this class, through a callback mechanism.
